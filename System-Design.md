# Clipmap Terrain
Some terrain systems generate a grid of mesh chunks, centered around the camera. As the camera moves forward, old meshes far behind are destroyed and new meshes in front are created.

Like The Witcher 3, this system uses a geometry clipmap, where the mesh components are generated once, and at periodic intervals are recentered on the camera location. Terrain3D updates when the camera moves 50% the width of the size of LOD0 (`clipmap_size`, which defaults to 48 units). On each update, the vertex heights are adjusted by the GPU reading from the terrain heightmap. LODs are built into the clipmap mesh generated on startup, so don't require any additional consideration once placed and heights adjusted.

# CPU Painting

This system does not paint directly on `Textures` using the GPU. It paints on [Images](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_image.html) using the CPU, which are then transferred to the GPU as textures. It's not ideal, but processing in C++ is reasonably fast. We have a hard brush size limit of 200 as larger is too sluggish.

Painting on the GPU is possible later, but there are some things needed in the engine. GPU Support is being tracked [here](https://github.com/outobugi/Terrain3D/issues/174).
