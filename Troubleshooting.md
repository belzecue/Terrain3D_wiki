Terrain3D has debugging logs for everything. Make sure you're running Godot with the console open. In the Terrain3D node, set debug_level to `debug`. 

To get help on anything you can't solve yourself, attach a full logs from your console. As long as Godot doesn't crash, it saves the log files on your drive. In Godot select, `Editor, Open Editor Data/Settings Menu`. On windows this opens `%appdata%\Godot` eg(`C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\Godot`). Look under `app_userdata\<your_project_name>\logs`. Otherwise you can copy and paste from the console window.
