## 1. Install dependencies

Follow Godot's instructions to set up your system to build Godot. You don't need the Godot source code, so stop before then. You only need the build tools, specifically `scons`, `python`, a compiler, and any other tools these pages identify. They provide easy installation instructions.

* [Linux/BSD](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/development/compiling/compiling_for_linuxbsd.html)
* [OSX](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/development/compiling/compiling_for_macos.html)


## 2. Download this repository

You can either grab the zip file, or clone it on the command line. Only type in the commands after the $ prompts.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:outobugi/GDExtensionTerrain.git

$ cd GDExtensionTerrain

GDExtensionTerrain$ git submodule init
Submodule 'godot-cpp' (https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp.git) registered for path 'godot-cpp'

GDExtensionTerrain$ git submodule update
Cloning into 'C:/GD/_plugins/TerrainGDEX/godot-cpp'...

```
Note the version it checked out: **9d1c396**...

This number is important for the next section.

## 3. Identify the appropriate godot-cpp version

At this time your version of godot-cpp must match the version of your Godot engine exactly. Use one of these steps to get the correct commit hash.

### Using the website
Look at the [godot-cpp commit history](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp/commits/master
) for your version. Search for entries named `Sync with upstream commit...`.


Eg, from Godot 4 Beta 14.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/632766/214382959-c6143e07-eb11-43ff-b654-75ed99fd033f.png)

Clicking the `...` on the right expands the description which shows `beta14`. This is the correct entry, and you want the commit string on the right in blue. Click the two overlapping squares on the right to copy the commit hash (`1909113`).


### Using the command line
Alternatively you can use git to search on the command line. This will search the server (origin) for all commit messages with `stable` allowing you to find the commits. Make sure to grab the top commit message (9d1c396c..), not the upstream commit shown at the bottom, which is from the Godot repository.
```
GDExtensionTerrain/godot-cpp$ git log origin -Gstable
commit 9d1c396c54fc3bdfcc7da4f3abcb52b14f6cce8f (HEAD -> master, tag: godot-4.0-stable, origin/master, origin/HEAD, origin/4.0)
Author: RÃ©mi Verschelde <rverschelde@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Mar 1 15:32:44 2023 +0100

    gdextension: Sync with upstream commit 92bee43adba8d2401ef40e2480e53087bcb1eaf1 (4.0-stable)

[truncated]
```

### Recent commits
Here are some godot-cpp commits for recent releases of Godot 4:
* 4.0 stable `9d1c396c54fc3bdfcc7da4f3abcb52b14f6cce8f`

### Check out the right version
Once you have the commit string, you just need to check it out. Git is smart enough to determine the hash you want with only the first 6-8 or so characters in a hash string. So `9d1c39` matches 4.0 stable above.

If the version checked out in step 3 above is not the version you want, then go back to the command line and change it. This will change it to Beta 12 for instance:

```
GDExtensionTerrain$ cd godot-cpp

GDExtensionTerrain/godot-cpp$ git checkout 9d1c396c54fc3bdfcc7da4f3abcb52b14f6cce8f
HEAD is now at 9d1c396 gdextension: Sync with upstream commit 92bee43adba8d2401ef40e2480e53087bcb1eaf1 (4.0-stable)
```

## 4. Build the extension

```
GDExtensionTerrain/godot-cpp$ cd ..

GDExtensionTerrain$ scons
```

Upon success you should see something like this at the end:

```
Creating library project\addons\terrain\bin\libterrain.windows.debug.x86_64.lib and object project\addons\terrain\bin\libterrain.windows.debug.x86_64.exp
scons: done building targets.

```


## 5. Set up the extension in Godot

* Close Godot. (Not required the first time, but required when updating the files.)
* Copy the files in `project/addons/terrain` to your own project folder under `/addons/terrain`. 
* Open Godot and create or open a scene. Add a new node and search for Terrain3D.


## Troubleshooting

### When running scons, I get these errors:

```
GDExtensionTerrain$ scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...

scons: warning: Calling missing SConscript without error is deprecated.
Transition by adding must_exist=False to SConscript calls.
Missing SConscript 'godot-cpp\SConstruct'
File "C:\gd\_plugins\GDExtensionTerrain\SConstruct", line 6, in <module>
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'Append':
  File "C:\gd\_plugins\GDExtensionTerrain\SConstruct", line 9:
    env.Append(CPPPATH=["src/"])

```

Your godot-cpp directory is probably empty. Review the instructions above for updating the submodule.

### I can build the plugin, however Godot instantly crashes. 
Your godot-cpp version probably does not match your engine version. At this time, they must match. Review the instructions above for switching versions. Test the example project in the next question.

### How can I make sure godot-cpp is the right version and working?
You'll find a test project in `godot-cpp/test/`. Make sure this test project works with your Godot version first, then come back and try GDExtensionTerrain again.
  * Build the example plugin in `godot-cpp/test/`.
  * Copy `example.gdextension` and `bin` into the root folder of your project.
  * Run Godot. If it crashes, you're on the wrong version, or Godot-cpp has a problem that the maintainers will need to resolve.
  * Create a new scene.
  * Add a new `Example` node. When clicking the node, you should see an `Example` section and `Property From List` and various `Dproperty#` variables in the inspector.
